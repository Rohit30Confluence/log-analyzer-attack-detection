## 🚀 Vision  

This repository represents an ongoing open-source initiative to engineer an **AI-driven Log Analysis & Attack Detection System**.  
The project focuses on building a scalable backend capable of detecting and analyzing **security threats in real-time**—including **SQL Injection**, **XSS**, **brute-force**, and **pattern-based attacks**—across distributed server and application logs.  

Hacktoberfest 2025 marked the beginning of this mission: transforming raw code contributions into meaningful, production-grade cybersecurity research.

## 🔬 Research & Development Focus (2025–2026)  

### 1. **AI-Augmented Threat Detection**  
- Build a **learning model** that adapts to new log patterns and reduces false positives.  
- Integrate with **MITRE ATT&CK** datasets for contextual analysis.  

### 2. **Collaborative Signature Library**  
- Launch a public open-source registry (`/rules/`) for community-contributed detection patterns.  
- Encourage global maintainers to submit YAML-based signatures for known and emerging threats.  

### 3. **Visualization & Analytics**  
- Develop an intuitive web dashboard to represent attack flow, frequency, and correlation in real-time.  
- Offer modular plugins for SOC teams and researchers.  

### 4. **Cross-Cloud Integration**  
- Expand deployment compatibility (Render, Fly.io, DockerHub).  
- Enable optional **Kafka or S3 ingestion pipelines** for enterprise-grade scalability.  

### 5. **Community Collaboration**  
- Open structured issues for first-time contributors and researchers.  
- Host mini-sprints leading up to **Hacktoberfest 2026** focusing on real-world threat simulation and response automation.
